This is a micro SCSS library to help you build websites in a matter of seconds, without all the arbitrary selectors.

* Only 37.03 kB (8.9 kB gzipped)
* Modular
* 2 configurable grid systems ([bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [flexboxgrid](http://flexboxgrid.com/))
* Adjust colors, borders, radius & sizes in the variables.scss file
* Responsive

Installation
-----------

```bash
bower install sierra --save
```


Using npm

```bash
npm install sierra-library --save-dev
```

or manually [download the library](https://github.com/sierra-library/sierra/archive/master.zip).

#### 2. Load the css stylesheet in your html file

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/sierra.min.css">
```


Customization
-----------
#### 1. Edit variables.scss file
This micro library is ready to be customized by editing the [variables.scss](https://github.com/sierra-library/sierra/blob/master/src/_variables.scss) file.

Start changing:

- Main font: `$basefont`.
- Brand colors: `$brand-primary`,  `$brand-secondary`, `$brand-dark`.
- Buttons border radius: `$button-border-radius`.
- [...]

#### 2. Install dependencies
After editing, run `$ npm install` from the projects root folder to install all dependencies (needs [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) installed).

#### 3. Compile the files
Run `$ gulp` to generate a new development file:  `dev/sierra.css`.

or

Run `$ gulp build` to generate a new production file:  `dist/sierra.min.css`.

Suggesting enhancements and reporting bugs
-----------
Since we're a very small community, we will appreciate every contribution   regardless of the size.

We will be happy to discuss new features and possible enhancements, so feel free to use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Sierra-Library/sierra/issues) for suggesting enhancements, new features and reporting bugs.

Once your enhancement/new feature is approved, you can open a Pull Request.

For small changes or misspellings, don't hesitate to open a pull request directly.

Contributing
-----------
Before creating a new Pull Request, open an issue at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Sierra-Library/sierra/issues). Just to make sure everybody feels comfortable with the change.
Remember to specify if you are able or unable, to develop the enhancement/feature.


#### Contributing rules
- Do not include unrelated commits in the same Pull Request.
- Use .editorconfig file located in the root folder. [More info](http://editorconfig.org/)
- Use the .scss-lint file located in the root folder.
- In order to make this library easy to maintain you can use mixins, placeholders and even functions if necessary. The golden rule here is keeping it as simple as possible. Sometimes is better a simple solution that takes a few more lines of code, rather than one that adds complexity for the sake of one-liners. Just use common sense here. In case of doubt join our chat at [sierra-library gitter](https://gitter.im/sierra-library/sierra).
- Many selector names can be improved, but try to avoid changing them (do it only if strictly necessary). We will change them in the V2 with BEM naming.


- Happy contributing everyone!
